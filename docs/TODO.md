Some things I should do in future:
General:
- [x] Make into a cmd tool
	- When more methods are added, it should be possible to turn them off and on
- [x] Fix the newline assembler message
- [ ] Add empty linker functions
- [ ] Get started on RISC-V version
- [ ] Get started on ARM version
Obfuscation Methods:
- [x] Add optional dead code into the empty functions
	- There should be a folder to add snippets of assembly code that could be randomly implemented
- [ ] Add some way to encrypt strings
	- Idea: XOR encryption? Hash function?
- [ ] Add useless jumps that do nothing
- [ ] Check out challenges.re for some ideas
