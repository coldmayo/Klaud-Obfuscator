# KlaudObfuscator

The goal of this program is to obfuscate (for now, just x86 assembly but I might get into RISC-V someday) code to make reverse engineering harder.

This will be good practice of lower level languages since I do not use them in my work.

I will likely use this to make crackmes in the future.
